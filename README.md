This repository contains the code underpinning Isla Barnard's PhD Thesis:
'Computational simulations of ultraviolet radiation penetration into human skin', 2021, University of St Andrews. 

Computational code is in Fortran 90; compiled using gfortran. 

This repository was created to allow creation of a single DOI for the code underpinning the thesis. As such, this single repo contains code from several different individual git repositories, each of which has its own branch. Code found within this repository has not been maintained since December 2020. For more up to date code, please see other repos.
