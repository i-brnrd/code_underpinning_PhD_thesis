# code_underpinning_PhD_thesis
This repository contains the code underpinning Isla Barnard's PhD Thesis:

'Computational simulations of ultraviolet radiation penetration into human skin', 2021, University of St Andrews.

Or explain the other route; undecided. 
This repository was created to allow creation of a single DOI for the code underpinning the thesis. As such, this single repo contains code from several different individual git repositories. Each repo resides in an orphan branch. Code found within this repository has not been maintained since December 2020. For more up to date code, please see publicly available repos by i-brnrd. 

This repo was created prior to publication of the thesis and as such does not contain a direct link to full text of the thesis.
For the full text, please try searching the St Andrews Research Repository: https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/
using the thesis title, 'Computational simulations of ultraviolet radiation penetration into human skin' (also search for 'Monte Carlo' for other publications from our group!). 
If this fails please raise an issue here, or in another repo, and I should be notified. 
I'm available on researchgate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Isla-Barnard and on linkedIn. 
	
This 'main' branch contains:
This readme and images. 

All computational code is in Fortran 90; compiled using gfortran. There may be files containing jupyter notebooks; used for generating plots.
